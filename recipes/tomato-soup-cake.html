    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Make this magic Tomato Soup Cake! It's based on a classic retro 1950s recipe, 
    with a whole can of soup in it. You can't taste the soup in the moist 
    and fluffy spice layer cake. </p>
        <p>
    Recipe from @bdylanhollis on TikTok.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 can condensed tomato soup</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. 
        Lightly grease 2 x 8-inch/20cm round cake pans.
    </li>
    
    <li>Add the condensed tomato soup (don’t add water) to a bowl and 
        stir in the baking soda (it will puff up a bit as it reacts with 
        the acidity). Set aside while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
    </li>
    
    <li>Add the sugar and butter to a mixing bowl and beat with an electric 
        mixer then beat in the eggs, one at a time, and the vanilla.
    </li>
    
    <li>Mix in the tomato soup. (Note: it might ‘split’ slightly but don’t worry, 
        it will come together with the flour).
    </li>
    
    <li>Sift in the flour, baking powder and spices, then gently mix to combine 
        (with a wooden spoon, don’t use the electric mixer). Don’t overmix, but 
        ensure no streaks of flour remain.
    </li>
    
    <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pans and bake for 25 minutes or until 
        an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Allow to cool in the pans for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire cooling 
        rack to cool completely.
    </li>
</ol>
